    "\n",
    "Consider the `insurance.csv`. This file contains information related customers' demographis and insurance premium. The goal is to build models to predict insurance premiums. Define the input (all variables but `charges`) and target variables. 0-1 encode the categorical features using `get_dummies`.\n",

    "### Exercise 1(a) (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `.py` file that reads the data and splits it into `train` (80%) and `test` (20%). Save both data-frames as `train.csv` and `test.csv`, respectively.\n",

    "### Exercise 1(b) (15 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `.py` file that reads the `train.csv` data file, tunes (using `Optuna`) and log the best `RandomForestRegressor` model out-of-sample performance (using `root_mean_squared_error`) over 5-folds in `mlflow`. Then, run the `permutation_importance` algorithm and identify the top five features. After that, re-run `Optuna` with the top five features and log the model performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Create a `.py` file that reads the `train.csv` data file, tunes (using `Optuna`) and log the best `ExtraTreesRegressor` model out-of-sample performance (using `root_mean_squared_error`) over 5-folds in `mlflow`. Then, run the `permutation_importance` algorithm and identify the top five features. After that, re-run `Optuna` with the top five features and log the model performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Create a `.py` file that reads the `train.csv` data file, tunes (using `Optuna`) and log the best `GradientBoostingRegressor` model out-of-sample performance (using `root_mean_squared_error`) over 5-folds in `mlflow`. Then, run the `permutation_importance` algorithm and identify the top five features. After that, re-run `Optuna` with the top five features and log the model performance.\n",

    "### Exercise 1(g) (7 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `.py` file that reads the `test.csv` data file. Load the best models from sections 1(b) to 1(e) to make predictions on the `test` dataset, and report their corresponding root mean squared errors (RMSE). Additionally, report the RMSE of the average ensemble of the models from sections 1(b) to 1(e).\n",
